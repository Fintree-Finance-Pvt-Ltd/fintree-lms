      other limitation(s), applicable to any authorized banking channel, including without limitation, IMPS,
      NEFT, RTGS, Cheque, UPI etc. and thus the disbursement may be made in tranches accordingly and the
      Borrower shall have no right or claim in any manner whatsoever against FFPL in case of delay of
      disbursement or lesser disbursement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Borrower may also avail Additional Loan in the form and manner prescribed by the Lender. The Additional
      Loan shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents, such other terms and conditions
      as may be prescribed by the Lender in this regard.
    </p>

    <div class="clause-heading mt-8">2.2 INTEREST AND OTHER CHARGES</div>

    <p>
      The Borrower agrees to pay interest on the Loan as per the Schedule. Interest on the Loan shall begin to
      accrue from the Disbursement Date at the applicable Interest Rate and shall be applied on a reducing
      balance taking a base of 365 days per year (irrespective of the leap year).
    </p>

    <p>
      FFPL shall be entitled to revise the Interest Rate at any time and from time to time as per its policy,
      if any, during the Loan Tenure, at its sole discretion or due to change in the regulatory requirements
      including any guidelines/ regulations issued by RBI and such revised Interest Rate shall be deemed to
      form part of the Loan and the Borrower shall also be liable to pay such revised amount of interest on the
      Loan in such manner and within such period as may be determined by the Lender in its sole discretion.
      Any such revision in the Interest Rates shall be effective from a prospective date and the Lender shall
      notify the Borrower via email or notice in advance to this effect and the same would be binding upon the
      Borrower. The Lender shall also notify any changes in its Interest Rates by updating the same on its
      Website.
    </p>

    <p>
      Borrower shall solely bear processing fees, cess, stamp duty or any other charges by whatever name be
      called including Goods and Service Tax (GST), if any, and in case the same are borne by FFPL, the Borrower
      agrees to pay the same separately.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case there is any Broken Period in the Loan Tenure under this Agreement, the Borrower shall pay the
      Broken Period Interest.
    </p>

    <p>
      FFPL shall be entitled to charge/debit the Borrower’s loan account(s) for all amounts due and payable by
      the Borrower under this Agreement including but not limited to interest, tax, fees, charges, stamp duty,
      processing fee, login fees, costs, service and other charges/expenses incurred by FFPL in relation to
      Loan Facility provided, unless separately reimbursed to/ collected upfront by FFPL from the Borrower.
      Such amount shall form part of the Loan.
    </p>

    <p>
      All amounts in default for payment (i.e. not paid by the Borrower when due to FFPL) including arrears of
      EMIs/EPIs, costs, interest, charges, fees, expenses etc. charged to the loan account(s), shall, inter
      alia, attract “Late Payment Charges” or “Penal Charges” as per Schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without prejudice to the Late Payment Charges as per the above clause, FFPL shall be entitled to impose
      and the Borrower shall be liable to pay Bounce Charges, Pre-Payment Charges, Mandate Swapping Charges or
      any other charges, as may be applicable, as detailed in the Schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Borrower agrees and acknowledges that the imposition of Penal Charges is essential to maintain the
      financial integrity of the lending process. By instilling a sense of credit discipline, these charges
      protect the revenue of the Lender and mitigate the risk of delinquency. They serve as a proactive measure
      to encourage timely repayment, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between the Lender and the
      Borrower. The Lender has and shall always endeavour to ensure that the quantum of these charges are
      reasonable and commensurate with the impact of the default, ensuring fairness and transparency in the
      lending relationship. For avoidance of doubt, the Lender does hereby declare that there is no
      capitalization of any penal charges. Without prejudice to the above, the Borrower understands and agrees
      that non capitalization of penal charges shall not impact the normal compounding of the interest in the
      Loan account(s).

  <!-- PAGE 3: Repayment + Additional Loan + KFS (summary text) -->
  <div class="page">
    <div class="clause-heading">2.3 REPAYMENT</div>

    <p>
      The Borrower agrees to repay the loan availed by him by way of Equated Periodic Instalments (EPI) on or
      before the monthly Due Date in terms of the Repayment Schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
      The repayment of loan (including the principal, interest thereon and any other charges, premium, fees,
      taxes, levies or other dues payable by the Borrower to FFPL in terms of this Agreement) will be made by
      the Borrower:
    </p>

    <p>
      (a) by way of Equated Periodic Instalment (EPI) via preferred repayment modes including but not limited to
      Post Date Cheques (PDCs)/NACH/e-NACH/ECS (“Debit Mandate”), as mentioned in the Schedule towards
      repayment of principal and interest amount; the Borrower agrees to give such Debit Mandate for the
      repayment of the loan and is fully cognizant of the fact that dishonor of such Debit Mandates is a
      criminal offence under the law. The Borrower undertakes to maintain his/her Bank account and will not
      close the Bank account during the continuance of this Agreement;
    </p>

    <p>
      (b) by way of cash in lieu of dishonored Debit mandates or otherwise due or payable through prescribed
      authorized payment channels as may be notified by FFPL.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Borrower agrees to continue paying EPI’s and other charges, costs, fees, expenses etc. charged to the
      Loan account, until all amounts due under the Loan have been repaid in full to FFPL.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that strict compliance with the Repayment Schedule is an essential
      condition for grant of this Loan Facility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Borrower understands and confirms that repayment of the loan is a non-negotiable obligation to be
      fulfilled by the Borrower and any dispute between the Borrower and the Beneficiary shall not waive the
      borrower’s repayment obligation under this Loan Agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Borrower understands and confirms that any dispute raised by him/her on the computation of the
      interest or any other term of the Loan availed by him shall not entitle the Borrower to withhold payment
      of any EPI.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Borrower agrees that in case a Debit Mandate is dishonored, he shall be liable to pay Bounce Charges
      as detailed in the Schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
      No notice, reminder or intimation will be given to the Borrower regarding his/her obligation to pay the
      EPI regularly on each Due Date. It shall, entirely, be his/her responsibility to ensure timely payment to
      FFPL. Any delay or default in payment of any EPI shall make the Borrower liable to pay to FFPL Late
      Payment Charges (for the period of such default) as mentioned in the Schedule, besides constituting an
      event of a default thereby entitling FFPL to terminate the Agreement, making all sums under this
      Agreement due and payable to FFPL immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      FFPL shall be entitled to recover from the Borrower prepayment charges at the rate mentioned in the
      Schedule on the amount of Loan, if the Borrower decides, after the expiry of 6 months from the date of
      disbursement (“Lock-in”), to foreclose the account ahead of the repayment terms i.e. pre-payment of Loan
      amount before the completion of tenure of Loan, as mentioned in the Schedule. However, the Borrower shall
      be liable to pay extra Pre-payment Charges, as mentioned in the Schedule, if the loan is closed within
      first 6 months.
