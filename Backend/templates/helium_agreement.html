    <p>

        other charges/expenses incurred by FFPL in relation to Loan Facility provided, unless

        declare that there is no capitalization of any penal charges. Without prejudice to the

        <strong>a.</strong> by way of Equated Periodic Instalment (EPI) via preferred repayment modes
        including but not limited to Post Date Cheques (PDCs)/NACH/e-NACH/ECS (“Debit Mandate”),
        as mentioned in the Schedule towards repayment of principal and interest amount; the
        Borrower agrees to give such Debit Mandate for the repayment of the loan and is fully
        cognizant of the fact that dishonor of such Debit Mandates is a criminal offence under the
        law. The Borrower undertakes to maintain his/her Bank account and will not close the Bank

        fees, expenses etc. charged to the Loan account, until all amounts due under the Loan have

    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2.3.4</strong> The Borrower understands and confirms that repayment of the loan is a
        non-negotiable obligation to be fulfilled by the Borrower and any dispute between the

        Loan Agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2.3.5</strong> The Borrower understands and confirms that any dispute raised by
        him/her on the computation of the interest or any other term of the Loan availed by him
        shall not entitle the Borrower to withhold payment of any EPI.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2.3.6</strong> The Borrower agrees that in case a Debit Mandate is dishonored, he
        shall be liable to pay Bounce Charges as detailed in the Schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2.3.7</strong> No notice, reminder or intimation will be given to the Borrower
        regarding his/her obligation to pay the EPI regularly on each Due Date. It shall, entirely,
        be his/her responsibility to ensure timely payment to FFPL. Any delay or default in payment
        of any EPI shall make the Borrower liable to pay to FFPL Late Payment Charges (for the
        period of such default) as mentioned in the Schedule, besides constituting an event of a
        default thereby entitling FFPL to determine terminate the Agreement, making all sums under
        this Agreement due and payable to FFPL immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2.3.8</strong> FFPL shall be entitled to recover from the Borrower prepayment
        charges at the rate mentioned in the Schedule on the amount of Loan, if the Borrower
        decides, after the expiry of 6 months from the date of disbursement (“Lock-in”), to
        foreclose the account ahead of the repayment terms i.e. pre-payment of Loan amount before
        the completion of tenure of Loan, as mentioned in the Schedule. However, the Borrower shall
        be liable to pay extra Pre-payment Charges, as mentioned in the Schedule, if the loan is
        closed within first 6 months.

        If any or all of Debit Mandates given to FFPL by the Borrower pursuant to above clauses:
        mandatess:

    <p><strong>a)</strong> is/are lost, destroyed or misplaced while in custody of FFPL, or</p>

    <p>
        <strong>b)</strong> become(s) non-encashable due to death, insolvency, lunacy, termination of
        Authority or otherwise of the signatory or any more of the signatories (if more than one

        Borrower (or the successor(s), legal representative of the Borrower) shall, on receipt of
        the intimation of such loss, destruction or misplacement (as the case may be) from FFPL,
        deliver to FFPL such number of Debit Mandates as are adequate to replace those that have
        been lost, destroyed, misplaced or become non-encashable or make such suitable arrangement
        for repayment of Loan as is acceptable to and approved by FFPL.

    <p>
        <strong>2.3.9</strong> It is agreed and understood by the Borrower that non-presentation of the
        Debit Mandates by FFPL due to any reason whatsoever will not affect the liability of the
        Borrower to repay the loan to FFPL and FFPL shall not, in any way, be responsible for delay,
        omission or neglect in encashment. The Borrower shall always maintain sufficient funds in
        his/her account to honour all the Debit Mandates becoming due and payable at any point of
        time. The Borrower warrants that in case any dispute is raised about the amount or interest
        computation, it shall not enable the Borrower to withhold payments of any EPI.

        amount in lieu of dishonored Mandate is deposited, FFPL shall not be liable for any
        consequences due to said double payment. However, excess payment shall be refunded or
        adjusted as per the mutual settlement between the Parties.

        <strong>2.3.11</strong> No damage, loss or delay in presentation of any Debit Mandate (already
        given by the Borrower to FFPL in terms hereof) for any reason whatsoever would, in any
        manner, mean waiver of any of the rights of FFPL.

    <p>
        <strong>2.3.12</strong> The Borrower shall undertake necessary due diligence and shall ensure
        not to deposit the EPI amount to any person/entity fraudulently claiming to be FFPL
        Representative for collection of repayment amount. The Borrower agrees that FFPL shall not
        be responsible for any loss/damage/costs incurred by the Borrower on account of any such
        event of fraud and that such events shall not relieve the Borrower of his liability to repay
        the Outstanding Dues under this Agreement.

    <h3>2.4 ADDITIONAL LOAN</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>2.4.1</strong> In case of loans for specific end use, the Borrower may opt to avail
        Additional Loan for the purpose mentioned in the Schedule which shall be disbursed to the
        Beneficiary’s Bank Account along with the Primary Loan. For avoidance of doubts, it is

        companies by the lending institution, the credit score of the borrower and guarantor, if any,
        shall be adversely impacted.
    </p>

    <h4>(iii) Upgradation of NPA accounts to Standard Accounts :</h4>

    <p>
        SMA/ NPA shall only be upgraded to standard account if payment of all past and current arrears
        of interest and principal (EMI)/and or any other amount overdue is made by the borrower at
        the time of running the day‐end activity of that particular date.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
        In the light of the above, the company advises all its customers to pay the installments and
        other amounts due, if any, on or before due dates without any delay or default to avoid
